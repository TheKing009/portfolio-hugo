Hi there...
I am Aayush Kashyap, and I'm not your traditional game developer. To begin with, I started game development at the age of 14 yrs with my first face-off with AS3, in the good old days of Flash-based web games. After that there was a plethora of engines that I experimented upon, from the block based Stencyl to the text based Unity. Finally I found an engine suited to my taste - Defold and have been developing 2D games on it for the past 2 yrs.
